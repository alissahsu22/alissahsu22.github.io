        skills: 'Animation, Procreate, Premiere Pro',
        description: 'Step into my mind palace? // This is the first "full" animation I have ever done. It was really fun to do all the sound design, editing, and learn about the traditional 2D frame-by-frame animation process like storyboarding and character design. The "mind palace" is something my friends and I reference a lot, especially when one of us seems in a state. As a result, I wanted to show viewers what was in my mind palace at this time and it had to deal with the pressure to be special/make something of yourself that I feel is a universal experience. The pressure to do something special can make it feel like the way you live your life is pointless otherwise but knowing that being born is enough to validate your existence is a good takeaway msg. <3'

High stress? // I wanted to experiment with user experiences on the web, so I made an interactive web "game" to take you through the highlights of my day and how I internally perceive them/express them through drawings. This was a good way to explore my interest in user interactions via the web and see how I can bring my animations to life in an interactive/dynamic way.'

I tried to incorporate all the things touch designer does well like (1) audio reactive visuals (2) 3D geometry (3) live webcam input (4) feedback/distortion/effects. It was a really great way to learn all the fundamentals of touch designer!'

(if have adobe aero use link: https://adobeaero.app.link/z8ptZ6CVHQb) // I wanted to experiment with AR in a 2D sense bc I don't currently have the tools to do 3D renderings on software like blender, so I thought this would be the next best thing. It was also a good ooportunity to experiment with what Adobe has to offer. It was super cool to make a 2D animation in AR and something I definitely want to do again. Seeing in AR in a 3D space definitely amplifies the experience and it is super cool!"

Paris is so beautiful and I love stained glass, so I wanted to express how beautiful Paris is in a 3D project. I made a weeping stained glass angel. I like the wings and if I was more experienced in 3D modeling I would've like to make a better body for the angel but I really had to simplify it given the limited shapes in three.js. This required a lot more math than I thought but it was still fun to do."

        description: "Submission for NYU Climate Change film festival 2025 // Making this animation gave me a new challenge as I had to incorporate statistics and fact in a way that was still engaging. It was a good experience and I'm glad I got to create a project abt something important. I care about climate change but it does seem like a very huge issue that I didn't even know if we (the world), let alone I, could do anything to fix so I wanted that to be the premise. After creating this project, I was able to learn a lot about informational storytelling and was given more hope about the individual impact with regards to helping in the fight against climate change."
