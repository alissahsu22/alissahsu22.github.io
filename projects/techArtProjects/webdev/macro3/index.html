            <p>Your goal in this game is to earn as many Pokeballs as possible while catching a variety of Pokemon along the way.</p>
            <p> To play, simply click on one of the three grass clumps in the forest. Behind one of those grass clumps is a Pokemon that can be caught. Behind another grass clump are two free Pokeballs that you can use to try again, and behind the last grass clump is nothing.</p>
            <p> Note that each time you pick a grass clump you will be using one of your Pokeballs, and when you run out the game is over!</p>
